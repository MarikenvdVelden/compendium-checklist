What is "version control", and why should you care?
Ever produced a text document, script or datafile with a title looking like this: <em>"FinalVersion2.0_REVISITED18may_FL"</em>?</br>
Version control is a way to organize your scripts in a reproducible, open, and transparent manner, and an additional advantage, you wil no longer produce files with such titles.
More precisely, version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
